Refined Request:

1. Autumn Leaves Animation:

Multiple Leaves Falling Realistically: When the webpage loads, I want 20 or more autumn leaves to fall from the top of the page in random positions, not all at once. They should fall in a natural, drifting manner as if caught in a gentle breeze.

Movement and Rotation: The leaves should rotate and swing randomly, but not in a mechanical way. They should appear to float down like real leaves would, moving left to right and gently spinning.

Depth and Realism: I want the leaves to look 3D and realistic, with natural textures, shadows, and depth (no emoji-style graphics). They should have a varied shape and color, representing different types of autumn leaves (e.g., red, orange, yellow, brown).

Gravity and Wind Effect: The leaves should fall slower at first, then accelerate slightly as they approach the bottom of the screen, showing a bit of gravity. The leaves should settle and drift around, instead of falling straight down like a rigid animation.

2. Leaf Blower Button:

Design of the Leaf Blower: The button should represent a realistic leaf blower (not just a circle with a wind symbol). Ideally, it should be a small, detailed icon of an actual leaf blower that looks like a real-world device with a handle, nozzle, etc. You could use an icon or a custom image for this.

Position and Interaction: The leaf blower should remain in the bottom-right corner and be clickable and draggable. When clicked and dragged, it should blow leaves away depending on the blower's location on the screen, like a real leaf blower would.

Blower Feedback: The blower should spin or vibrate slightly when in use, giving visual feedback that it’s active.

3. Blowing Leaves Away:

Realistic Blowing Effect: When the leaf blower is dragged around the screen or activated, it should blow the leaves off the screen in a more realistic way, instead of sending them into a vacuum. The leaves should change direction based on the proximity and angle of the blower. If the blower is moved close to the leaves, they should float or be blown gently in a realistic trajectory, not in a fixed or robotic path.

Leaf Behavior Based on Proximity: The closer the blower is to the leaves, the more intense the blowing should be. If the blower is near the leaves, they should speed up or float away in response to the blower’s power. If the blower is farther away, the leaves should move slowly or gently, simulating the weaker wind effect.

Gravity vs. Wind: I want the wind effect (from the blower) to feel like it competes with gravity. The leaves should fall and settle naturally, and the blower’s wind should only interfere when close enough, causing the leaves to be blown off-screen in a realistic arc or direction. Some leaves should even come to a stop mid-air, like they’re floating gently or being lifted by a gust of wind.

4. Background Layer and Persistence of Leaves:

The falling leaves should remain as part of the background layer and keep reappearing after being blown away. It’s important that the leaves don’t disappear completely—they should feel like a constant cycle of falling and being blown around, giving the impression of a gentle autumn wind.

5. Overall Aesthetic and Fluidity:

The leaves should feel like they’re part of the environment, and the entire animation should be smooth and fluid, without harsh jumps or fixed behaviors.

The blower should feel integrated into this natural movement, interacting with the leaves in a way that’s engaging and not forced.

Key Points to Emphasize:

Realistic Physics: You want to avoid the emoji-like, mechanical movement of the leaves, so emphasizing the gravity and wind interaction will help. Also, the leaves should drift and not fall in a straight line.

Visual Design: Emphasize 3D depth and texture for the leaves, as well as a more realistic design for the blower.

Interactive Blower: Make sure the blower’s behavior is dynamic, meaning it should change its effect on the leaves based on proximity, angle, and user interaction (dragging).

Persistent Background Animation: The falling leaves should continue to drift across the screen, and not just disappear once the blower is used. The blower and the falling leaves should have an ongoing, cyclical interaction.
